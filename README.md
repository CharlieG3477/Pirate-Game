This is the repository for a game created by me and Dennis Huynh. It is our first game.

Pirate Ship Roguelike (Dead Men Die Again)

	Concept:
		Have a map with 10 or so islands with the final boss marked or have to find clues to mark the final boss. Longer it takes to get to the boss the stronger it gets, fight enemies at sea and on land to upgrade the ship/crew. Upgrades and items. Random encounters in the water. Able to name the ship. 

		Have differenct classes or different starting ships to choose from (different cannons, different sails (for different speeds, turning, etc), different tankiness, different ammo, different crew

	Plan:
		Make the water, ship, and character model. 		
		Be able to drive the ship. 

	Mechanics:
		ping where to go or map navigation, or use the map to mark and go. 
		No repairs for now unless you are at an island
		Minigames for different ship tasks
		Merchant convoys, in game quests, kraken, megalodon, giant squid, storms

	Style:
		Cartoonny, not realistic. Third person.
		
	UI:
		Compass, Health (Ship and player), ammo, speed, 

	Problems:
		Ship mechanics are tedious. 

	Addons:
		Seas shanties
		Character/Ship customization
		Pets
		Prestige mechanic
		unlock new items, crew members
